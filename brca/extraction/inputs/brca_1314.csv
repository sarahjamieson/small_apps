Final	Annette Copeland has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 24 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to G base substitution at nucleotide position 9175 (c.9175A>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid lysine for glutamic acid at codon 3059 (p.Lys3059Glu). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Previous sequence analysis of DNA extracted from Pamela Hodgetts by the East Midlands Regional Molecular Genetics Service detected the c.8632G>A p.(Glu2878Lys) variant in the BRCA2 gene. BRCA2 RNA studies have been performed to help clarify the significance of this sequence change. RT-PCR and sequence analysis using RNA extracted from Pamela Hodgetts' peripheral blood showed a heterozygous deletion of exon 20 (r.[=,8488_8632del]). This deletion is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Trp2830Lysfs*13). Exon 20 skipping was not observed in any of the normal controls tested. These studies show that the c.8632G>A missense variant causes aberrant splicing and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. It is now possible to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives. If you would like to discuss these results further please contact the laboratory.

Final	Previous sequence analysis of Chinana Bokembo's genomic DNA identified the sequence variant, c.81-12C>G (see report D11.43941). RNA studies were requested to investigate the possible pathogenicity of this variant through a splicing affect. No aberrant splicing products were identified using RNA extracted from Chinana's leukocyte cells.

Final	Previous sequence analysis of DNA extracted from Monica Szczepankowska identified the c.4986+4A>T variant in intron 16 the BRCA1 gene (see D11.16927, report date 21/07/2011). BRCA1 RNA studies have been performed to help clarify the significance of this sequence change. RT-PCR and sequence analysis using RNA extracted from Monica Szczepankowska's peripheral blood has shown the presence of both an mRNA product with the retention of the first 65 bases of intron 16 and a normal mRNA product [r.=,4986_4987ins4986+1_4986+65]. This abberant splicing is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Met1663Valfs*14). Partial intron 16 retention was not observed in any of the normal controls tested. These studies demonstrate that the c.4986+4A>T variant causes aberrant splicing and it is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. It is now possible to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives.

No evidence of a known pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2."	Final	Previous molecular analysis of DNA from Madeleine Keegan identified a missense variant (c.5576C>G; p.Pro1859Arg) in exon 24 of BRCA1. This sequence change was reported as a missense variant of unknown clinical significance (our report D09.21727, dated 21/08/2009). The results of a recent investigation of the pathogenicity of this variant have shown that although it is reported as an unclassified variant on the BIC database, Easton et al. (Am J Hum Genet. 81(5):873-83 2007) and Lindor et al. (Hum Mutat. 33(1):8-21 2012) concluded that this sequence variant is not deleterious based on epidemiological and biological criteria. Based on all the current available evidence, there is no evidence to suggest that this variant is of any clinical significance.

However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

The previously reported BRCA1 missense variant (c.3421G>A, p.Ser1101Asn) is likely to be a benign polymorphism."	Final	VARIANT UPDATE REPORT: Previous molecular analysis of DNA from Michelle Beecham identified a missense variant (c.3421G>A, p.Ser1101Asn) in exon 11 of BRCA1. This sequence change was reported as a missense variant of unknown clinical significance (our report D07.20208, dated 15/08/2007). The p.Ser1101Asn variant has been reported as an unclassified variant on the BIC database. However, Easton et al. (2007, Am J Hum Genet Vol. 81 No. 5: 873-883) concluded that this sequence change is not deleterious based on epidemiological and biological criteria. Therefore, this variant is likely to be a benign polymorphism and presymptomatic and segregation testing is not recommended. If you wish to discuss this result further please contact the laboratory.

The previously reported BRCA2 missense variant (c.3445A>G; p.Met1149Val) may cause aberrant splicing of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene."	Final	VARIANT UPDATE REPORT Previous molecular analyses of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous missense variant of unknown clinical signifcance (c.3445A>G; p.Met1149Val). Please note, this variant was previously described as c.3673A>G (our ref D04.21970, report dated 06/03/2006). In-silico evidence predicts that this variant may alter splicing of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene. It is possible to assess whether the variant does cause aberrant splicing by performing RT-PCR analysis. If you would like to initiate this testing please send a fresh blood sample (5-10ml in EDTA) to this laboratory quoting our reference (D04.21970) as well as stating that the sample is for RNA studies on the referral form.

The previously reported BRCA2 missense variants p.Thr598Ala and p.Gly602Arg are now classified as a benign polymorphism and unlikely to be of clinical significance, respectively."	Final	VARIANT UPDATE REPORT: Previous molecular analyses of DNA from Victoria Corfield identified two missense variants (c.1792A>G; p.Thr598Ala and c.1804G>A; p.Gly602Arg) in exon 10 of the BRCA2 gene. Please note, these variants were previously described as c.2020A>G and c.2032G>A, respectively. Both sequence changes were previously reported as missense variants of unknown clinical significance (our report D03.04616 dated 02/02/2006). The c.1792A>G (p.Thr598Ala) variant is now classified as a benign polymorphism and is therefore of no clinical importance. The c.1804G>A (p.Gly602Arg) variant is now listed as neutral on the Universal Mutation Database (UMD), having a neutrality odds ratio of 1:2020 (Easton et al, Am J Hum Genet. 2007 Nov;81(5):873-83).

Final	Previous MLPA analysis identified an apparent heterozygous tandem duplication of exon 21 in the BRCA2 gene (GSTS lab ref: 12/15062). RNA studies have been requested to help characterise the nature of this duplication. RT-PCR and sequence analysis using RNA extracted from Adelia Moreira's peripheral blood has shown evidence of a heterozygous tandem duplication of exon 21 of the BRCA2 gene. This product was not seen in any of the normal control samples. This duplication is predicted to result in the introduction of a premature termination codon (p.Gly2919Lysfs*13) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast cancer in Adelia Moreira. It is now possible to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives as appropriate.

Heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.6980delT; p.Leu2327*) identified in exon 13 of the BRCA2 gene within this family."	Final	INTERNAL REPORT FOR LABORATORY USE ONLY- SEE D12.41802 Janet Clarke has a family history of BRCA1 and BRCA2 related cancers but is not clinically affected. Indirect testing of Janet and other at risk family members has been requested because DNA is not available from an affected relative. Sequence analyses of DNA from these at risk family members has identified a heterozygous 1bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 6980 (c.6980delT) in exon 13 of the BRCA2 gene. This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Leu2327*) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This mutation has been identified in Janet Clarke’s family, and not necessarily in Janet. A further report detailing Janet's result will be issued on request. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any other at risk relatives. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Lorraine Justice has a confirmed family history of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. She has been referred for predictive testing of a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation previously identified in an affected family member tested at another laboratory (our reference D13.00674). Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene has shown that Lorraine Justice has inherited the familial pathogenic mutation c.6052_6053delAG (p.Ser2018*) in the heterozygous state. This result indicates that Lorraine Justice has an approximately 88% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 37% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer (Evans et al., BMC Cancer, 2008; 8:155).

Final	Diane Sinclair has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to G base substitution at nucleotide position 2330 (c.2330A>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid aspartic acid for glycine at codon 777 (p.Asp777Gly). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Nicola O'Toole has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous 5bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 4398 (c.4398_4402delACATT). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon p.(Leu1466Phefs*2) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Nicola O'Toole.

Final	Jane O'Neill has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer and family history of ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous C to T base substitution at nucleotide position *14 (c.*14C>T) within the 3'UTR. This sequence change has not been reported previously. In the absence of functional assays the pathological significance of this sequence change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Sequencing analysis has detected one of the three common Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations. A deletion of a single base starting at nucleotide position 5946 (c.5946delT) was identified in exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene. This mutation is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Ser1982Argfs*22) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. Neither of the other two common pathogenic mutations were detected. This result means that if female this patient has an approximate lifetime risk of 45% for breast cancer and 15-20% for ovarian cancer. If male, this patient has a risk of 6-7% for breast cancer and between 5-25% for prostate cancer (figures taken from GCaPPS educational booklet). Presymptomatic testing may now be offered to at risk family members following appropriate genetic counselling. It is recommended that the other two common mutations are also screened for in at risk relatives in order to identify compound and double heterozygotes.

Final	Suzanne Silcox has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous 2bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 6275 (c.6275_6276delTT). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Leu2092Profs*7) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Suzanne Silcox. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. For information: A nonsense variant in exon 27 of BRCA2 (c.9976A>T; p.Lys3326*) was identified. This sequence change has previously been reported to be a polymorphic stop codon on the BIC database and is not associated with an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. However, a study by Martin et al. (Oncogene 24(22) 3652-56 2005) found an increased prevalence of this sequence change in patients with familial pancreatic cancer.

Final	Catherine Abbott has a personal history of breast cancer and a confirmed family history of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. She has been referred for molecular testing to detect a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation previously identified in an affected family member (our reference: D11.42172). Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene has shown no evidence of the familial c.1175_1214del40 (p.Leu392Glnfs*5) pathogenic mutation. This result shows that the familial c.1175_1214del40 (p.Leu392Glnfs*5) pathogenic mutation has not contributed to the development of Catherine Abbott's breast cancer. It is likely that she has developed breast cancer as a result of factors affecting the general population.

Final	Barbara Brennan has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer and family history of ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to A base substitution at nucleotide position 5635 (c.5635G>A) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamic acid for lysine at codon 1879 (p.Glu1879Lys). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Jackie Harrington has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Molecular analyses performed on DNA from Jackie have not detected a known pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. For information: A nonsense variant in exon 27 of BRCA2 (c.9976A>T; p.Lys3326*) was identified. This sequence change has previously been reported to be a polymorphic stop codon on the BIC database and is not associated with an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. However, a study by Martin et al. (Oncogene 24(22) 3652-56 2005) found an increased prevalence of this sequence change in patients with familial pancreatic cancer.

Final	Parminder Jalaf has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous 2bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 3770 (c.3770_3771delAG). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Glu1257Glyfs*9) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic.

Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. In addition, sequence analysis of exon 11of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to T base substitution at nucleotide position 3882 (c.3882A>T) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid leucine for phenylalanine at codon 1294 (p.Leu1294Phe).

Final	Colette Fitzsimons has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Molecular analyses performed on DNA from Colette Fitzsimons have not detected a known pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. For information only: Sequence analysis of exon 3 of the BRCA2 gene identified a T to A base substitution in intron 2 (c.68-7T>A). RNA studies in another patient with this variant detected an in-frame deletion of exon 3. However, the same deletion was observed in normal control samples and therefore appears to be a normal splicing isoform rather than the result of the intronic variant. We have also seen this variant in conjunction with pathogenic BRCA2 mutations in two BRCA families. This suggests that the variant is not likely to be clinically significant.

Final	Jayne Blount has a personal history of melanoma and a family history of ovarian cancer.

Final	Mary Burke has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous 1bp deletion at nucleotide position 1018 (c.1018delG). This change results in the substitution of the amino acid valine at position 340 for a stop codon (p.Val340*) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Mary Burke. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. For information only: Sequence analysis of exon 3 of the BRCA2 gene identified a T to A base substitution in intron 2 (c.68-7T>A). RNA studies in another patient with this variant detected an in-frame deletion of exon 3, however the same deletion was observed in normal control samples. It's co-occurrence with a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation suggests that this variant is not likely to be clinically significant. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Missense variant of unknown clinical significance also detected."	Final	Ian Hutchinson has a confirmed family history of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. He has been referred for predictive testing of a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation previously identified in an affected family member tested at another laboratory (our reference D13.15153). Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene has shown that Ian Hutchinson has inherited the familial pathogenic mutation c.6535_6536insA (p.Val2179Aspfs*10) in the heterozygous state. This result indicates that Ian Hutchinson has an approximately 6-9% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and is also at risk of other specific BRCA2-associated cancers such as prostate cancer (Evans et al., J Med Genet, 2010). A heterozygous nucleotide change (c.6818G>A; p.Arg2273Lys) was also identified in the same exon in both Ian Hutchinson and his sister. This variant appears to be in trans with the pathogenic frameshift mutation. It has not previously been reported on either the BIC database or in the literature, and is currently of unknown clinical significance. Testing Ian Hutchinson's parents, if available, to establish phase of the identified frameshift mutation and missense variant followed by testing other family members may help to clarify the implications of this finding.

Final	Kathleen Coffey has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 23 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous G to A base substitution at nucleotide position 5444 (c.5444G>A). This change results in the substitution of the amino acid tryptophan at position 1815 for a stop codon (p.Trp1815*) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic.

Final	Sandra Mullins has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Molecular analyses performed on DNA from Sandra have not detected a known pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. For information only: sequencing analysis of exon 16 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous base substitution at nucleotide position 4910 (c.4910C>T) resulting in the substitution of the amino acid proline for leucine at codon 1637 (p.Pro1637Leu). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the BIC database. However, Easton et al.

Final	Sandra Wilkinson has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 24 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to A base substitution at nucleotide position 9155 (c.9155G>A) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid Arg for Gln at codon 3052 (p.Arg3052Gln). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant.

Final	Sequencing analysis has detected one of the three common Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations. A duplication of a single base starting at nucleotide position 5266 (c.5266dupC) was identified in exon 20 of the BRCA1 gene. This mutation is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Gln1756Profs*74) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. Neither of the other two common pathogenic mutations were detected. This result means that if female this patient has an approximate risk of 60-65% for breast cancer and 35-45% for ovarian cancer. If male, this patient has a risk of 5-25% for prostate cancer (figures taken from GCaPPS educational booklet). Presymptomatic testing may now be offered to at risk family members following appropriate genetic counselling. It is recommended that the other two common mutations are also screened for in at risk relatives in order to identify compound and double heterozygotes.

Final	Lesley Hunting has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 10 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous C to A base substitution at nucleotide position 1166 (c.1166C>A) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid proline to glutamine at codon 389 (p.Pro389Gln). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. For information only: a heterozygous nucleotide change in exon 11 of BRCA2 (c.5901G>A; p.=) was also identified. This has not previously been reported on the BIC database and is not known to be of any clinical significance at present. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

It therefore appears that this variant may be segregating with cancer in this family, however the possibility that it is a segregating benign variant cannot be ruled out. Loss of heterozygosity studies in tumour tissue (if available) from family members carrying this variant may help to further clarify its significance.

4543074351	417827	02/07/50	Monica	CORBETT	D13.15595	ANCO	BRCA	Presymptomatic	10/05/13	C10-Presym +ve Pathogenic	Molecular analysis has shown the familial pathogenic mutation c.4065_4068delTCAA (p.(Asn1355Lysfs*10)) in exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene.	Final	Monica Corbett has a confirmed family history of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. She has been referred for predictive testing of a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation previously identified in a family member tested at another laboratory (our reference D13.16665). Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene has shown that Monica Corbett has inherited the familial pathogenic mutation c.4065_4068delTCAA (p.(Asn1355Lysfs*10)) in the heterozygous state. This result indicates that Monica Corbett has an approximately 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 65% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer (Evans et al., BMC Cancer, 2008; 8:155). If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory. These results are dependent upon the information supplied being correct and complete.	5JA	CV9 3QH

Final	Jeanette Lawrence has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast/ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous 4bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 2808 (c.2808_2811delACAA). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Ala938Profs*21) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Jeanette Lawrence. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory. These results are dependent upon the information supplied being correct and complete.	5MQ	CV37 7DF

Final	Kathleen Ford has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 24 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to T base substitution at nucleotide position 9159 (c.9159G>T) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamic acid to aspartic acid at codon 3053 (p.Glu3053Asp). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Susan Wood has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 20 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous T to C base substitution at nucleotide position 5207 (c.5207T>C) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid valine to alanine at codon 1736 (p.Val1736Ala). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. However it has also been reported in a number of studies (see references below) which have used segregation analysis (1), LOH studies in tumours (1), conservation studies (1) as well as functional assays (1, 2 and 3) to investigate pathogenicity. Together, the evidence from these studies indicate that this amino acid change is likely pathogenic consistent with the diagnosis of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Susan Wood.

Final	Moira Bull has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 10 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous G to T base substitution at nucleotide position 661 (c.661G>T) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid alanine for serine at codon 221 (p.Ala221Ser). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Lynn Higgott has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous 2bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 981 (c.981_982delAT). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Cys328*) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Lynn Higgott. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

In addition, there is no evidence of the two other common pathogenic Ashkenazi Jewish mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.	Final	Helen Street has a confirmed family history of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer and is possibly of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Sequencing analysis of exon 20 of the BRCA1 gene has not shown the presence of the c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs*74) pathogenic mutation previously detected in an affected family member (our reference D02.20396). Please note, this mutation was previously known as c.5382dupC. This pathogenic mutation and two other pathogenic mutations (BRCA1 exon 2 c.68_69delAG and BRCA2 exon 11 c.5946delT) are found at a greater frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Additional sequence analysis has shown that Helen Street does not carry either of these common pathogenic Ashkenazi Jewish mutations.

Final	Bridie Turner has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis has identified two missense variants: a heterozygous C to G base substitution at nucleotide position 4327 (c.4327C>G) in exon 13 of the BRCA1 gene resulting in the replacement of the amino acid arginine for glycine at codon 1443 (p.Arg1443Gly) and in addition, a heterozygous C to T base substitution at nucleotide position 3515 (c.3515C>T) in exon 11of the BRCA2 gene resulting in the replacement of the amino acid serine for leucine at codon 1172 (p.Ser1172Leu).

Heterozygous missense variant (c.2189A>C p.Glu730Ala) identified in exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene."	Final	AMENDED REPORT issued 09/08/13 Pamela Evans has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous A to C base substitution at nucleotide position 2189 (c.2189A>C) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamic acid to alanine at codon 730 (p.Glu730Ala). This missense variant was previously detected in an affected family member (our lab ref D12.42217). It therefore appears that this variant may be segregating with cancer in this family, however the possibility that it is a segregating benign variant cannot be ruled out. Loss of heterozygosity studies in tumour tissue from family members carrying this variant may help to further clarify its significance. Screening other more distantly related affected relatives would also contribute to assessing the likelihood of it being pathogenic.

No evidence of LOH for the BRCA2 sequence variant c.520C>T in either breast or ovarian tumour tissue."	Final	Jane Gee has a personal history of breast cancer. Previous sequence analysis identified two constitutional missense variants: c.5207T>C, p.(Val1736Ala) in BRCA1 and c.520C>T, p.(Arg174Cys) in BRCA2 (analysis performed in another laboratory). The c.520C>T nucleotide change in BRCA2 was reported as likely pathogenic based on RNA studies (Wessex laboratory, report not seen). Loss of heterozygosity studies for both nucleotide changes has been requested in both breast and ovarian tumour tissue. Sequence analysis of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded ovarian tissue and breast tumour has confirmed the presence of both nucleotide changes. There was no evidence of loss of the wild type allele in ovarian tissue for either variant. Evidence of loss of the wild type allele was detected in breast tumour tissue for the BRCA1 c.5207T>C variant but not for the BRCA2 variant. This result does not exclude pathogenicity of the BRCA2 variant. The result for the BRCA1 c.5207T>C variant is consistent with a report in the literature (see reference below). For your information: this nucleotide change has been seen in this laboratory and shown to segregate with cancer in muliple affected individuals and is therefore considered as pathogenic.

Final	Jacqueline Wood has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to G base substitution at nucleotide position 5900 (c.5900A>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid lysine with arginine at codon 1967 (p.Lys1967Arg). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time.

Final	Karen Morgan has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequence analysis of exon 25 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to T base substitution at nucleotide position +3 (c.9501+3A>T) close to the splice donor site of the exon 25/intron 25 boundary. This sequence change has been reported on both the BIC and HGMD databases and is also reported in the literature. Functional studies performed on patient RNA and using a minigene reporter assay have shown that this variant induces exon 25 skipping but with a predominance of wild type product, suggesting incomplete penetrance (Bonnet et al., JMG, 2008, 45:7). It is therefore highly likely that the c.9501A>T variant is pathogenic, however, prior to offering any presymptomatic testing to at-risk relatives, we recommend RNA studies and segregation analyses in affected relatives to confirm the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. For information: In addition to the above, a nonsense variant in exon 27 of BRCA2 (c.9976A>T, p.Lys3326*) was identified. This sequence change has previously been reported to be a polymorphic stop codon on the BIC database and is not associated with an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer.

This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast cancer in Amanda Tromans. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. For information: A nonsense variant in exon 27 of BRCA2 (c.9976A>T; p.Lys3326X) was identified. This sequence change has previously been reported to be a polymorphic stop codon on the BIC database and is not associated with an increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. However, a study by Martin et al. (Oncogene 24(22) 3652-56 2005) found an increased prevalence of this sequence change in patients with familial pancreatic cancer.

Sequencing analysis of exon 10 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous C to G base substitution at nucleotide position 1427 (c.1427C>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid serine for cysteine at codon 476 (p.Ser476Cys). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. In addition, sequencing analysis of exon 14 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to C base substitution at nucleotide position 7263 (c.7263G>C) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamine for histidine at codon 2421 (p.Gln2421His). This sequence change has not been reported on the BIC database or in the literature. The pathological significance of both of these amino acid changes is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of these sequence variants.

Final	Elinah Mhlanga has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous A to G base substitution at nucleotide position 1427 (c.1427A>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid histidine to arginine at codon 476 (p.His476Arg). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. For information only: a heterozygous nucleotide change in intron 2 of BRCA1 (c.81-12C>G) was identified. This sequence change has been reported on the BIC database as an unclassified variant. In silico analyses of this variant predicts that it disrupts splicing between intron 2 and exon 3. However RNA analysis in this laboratory in another affected patient with this variant showed no aberrant splicing products. This result suggests that either the c.81-12C>G variant has no effect upon splicing or that any potential effects are beyond the limits of detection of this assay design. This sequence variant has also been identified in a patient with a known pathogenic BRCA1 mutation. Therefore this variant is not known to be of any clinical significance at present. As requested, TP53 gene testing will now be activated. Page 1 of 2 Page 2 of 2 If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene identified a heterozygous 5bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 2076 (c.2076_2080delTGACA). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.His692Glnfs*18) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Madhusri Dutta. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. For information only: a heterozygous 1bp deletion in intron 10 of the BRCA1 gene (c.671-12delG) was identified. This change has been reported on the BIC database as an unclassified variant and given the above result is unlikely to be of any clinical significance.

Sequencing analysis of exon 14 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous 2bp deletion starting at nucleotide position 7069 (c.7069_7070delCT). This sequence change is predicted to create a downstream stop codon (p.Leu2357Valfs*2) and is therefore considered to be pathogenic. This result is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer in Amanda Butler. Based on this result it is possible to offer presymptomatic testing to any at risk relatives. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Corrie Humphrys has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and/or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 25 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to A base substitution at nucleotide position 9354 (c.9354G>A) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid Methionine for Isoleucine at codon 3118 p.(Met3118Ile). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant.

She has been referred for predictive testing of a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation previously identified in an affected family member tested at another laboratory (our reference D13.35448). Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA1 gene has shown that Serena Day has inherited the familial pathogenic mutation c.3770_3771delAG, p.(Glu1257Glyfs*9) in the heterozygous state. This result indicates that Serena Day has an approximately 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 65% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer (Evans et al., BMC Cancer, 2008; 8:155). For information only: a heterozygous synonymous change (c.3792G>A; p.=) was also identified.

Final	Michele Parfitt has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and/or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 10 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to C base substitution at nucleotide position 1291 (c.1291A>C) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid threonine for proline at codon 431, p.(Thr431Pro). This sequence change has not been reported on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact the laboratory.

Final	Geraldine McGee has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Molecular analyses performed on DNA from Geraldine McGee have not detected a known pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. For information only: sequencing analysis of exon 22 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous C to T base substitution at nucleotide position 8917 (c.8917C>T) resulting in the substitution of the amino acid arginine for cysteine at codon 2973 (p.Arg2973Cys). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the BIC database. However, Easton et al. (Am J Hum Genet. 81(5):873-83 2007) concluded that this sequence variant is not deleterious based on epidemiological and biological criteria. At the current time there is no evidence to suggest that this variant is of any clinical significance. If you wish to discuss this result please contact this laboratory.

Final	Sandra Mulholland has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic analysis. Sequencing analysis of exon 27 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous A to G base substitution at nucleotide position 10120 (c.10120A>G) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid threonine for alanine at codon 3374 (p.(Thr3374Ala)). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance.

Final	Noeleen O'Brien has been referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis due to a personal and family history of breast cancer. Sequencing analysis of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene identified a heterozygous G to T base substitution at nucleotide position 3504 (c.3504G>T) resulting in the replacement of the amino acid methionine to isoleucine at codon 1168 (p.(Met1168Ile)). This sequence change has previously been reported as an unclassified variant on the Breast cancer Information Core (BIC) database. The pathological significance of this amino acid change is unclear. It is therefore not appropriate to offer presymptomatic testing to at risk relatives at this time. However, screening other affected relatives in this family may help to clarify the pathogenicity of this sequence variant. No other variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified other than common polymorphisms of no known significance.

MLPA analysis of the BRCA1 gene has shown the presence of the familial heterozygous pathogenic deletion of exon 3. Sequence analysis of exon 3 of BRCA1 showed no evidence of a variant which could interfere with MLPA probe hybridisation. This result indicates that Claire Orr has an approximately 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 65% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer (Evans et al., BMC Cancer, 2008; 8:155).
